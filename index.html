    <b>From failure's grasp, we learn to soar,<br>
    With newfound strength, to reach for more.<br>
    When failure strikes and deals its blow,<br>
    We find within ourselves to grow.<br>
    <br>
    Through falls and stumbles, we refine,<br>
    Our character and will align.<br>
    Every failure is a test,<br>
    A chance to grow, to be our best.<br>
    <br>
    So let us embrace each failure's sting,<br>
    For it's through them, success we'll bring.<br>
    Because in our struggles, we discover<br>
    A path to success, like no other.
