From failure’s grasp, we learn to soar,
With newfound strength, to reach for more.
When failure strikes and deals its blow,
We find within ourselves to grow

Through falls and stumbles, we refine,
Our character and will align.
Every failure is a test,
A chance to grow, to be our best.

So let us embrace each failure’s sting,
For it’s through them, success we’ll bring.
Because in our struggles, we discover
A path to success, like no other.
