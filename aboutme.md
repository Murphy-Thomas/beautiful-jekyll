# My story (so far)

Growing up in Portland, Oregon, I developed a deep love for the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest. From the lush forests to the rolling hills and the rugged coastlines, I was constantly inspired by my surroundings and the endless adventures that awaited me in the great outdoors. Soccer was also a big part of my childhood and I was dedicated to the sport from a young age. I played on local teams, honing my skills and competing against other players from the area. My love of the game continued to grow, and I played competitively until I graduated from high school. The experiences I had on the soccer field taught me the value of hard work, teamwork, and perseverance, and have stayed with me to this day.

I have always been driven by a passion for science, which led me to study molecular biology and genomics at Oregon State University. During my time there, I was introduced to the fascinating world of academic research and discovered a deep love for the field. I was drawn in by the endless possibilities for discovery and the potential to make a real impact on people's lives through scientific advancements. As I delved deeper into my studies, the more knowledge and experience I cultivated. My passions only grew stronger. I now hope to make meaningful contributions to the scientific community and continue to grow my knowledge and expertise.

In my free time, I like to delve into the captivating world of books. Reading allows me to escape into different realms, imagine different realities, and gain new perspectives. My love for literature encompasses a range of genres, from the otherworldly adventures of fantasy to the insightful pages of nonfiction. I also enjoy listening to podcasts and staying up-to-date with current events and new ideas. And when the need for fresh air and adventure strikes, I hit the trails in the stunning Pacific Northwest, immersing myself in the region's breathtaking natural beauty.

The backdrop to my journey has also been painted by challenges I've faced related to depression, ADHD, and other mental health issues. I have struggled with these difficulties and can often feel overwhelmed by them. However, I have learned that these difficulties, which can often lead to many failures, are also how we grow. Overcoming the challenges and becoming stronger. Mental health is a critical aspect of our overall well-being and I am passionate about promoting its importance, both in ourselves and in those around us. The connections we make and the communities we build are what truly matter in life. I strive to create a better world and to support others on their own journeys.
