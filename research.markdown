# Title Here

I've always been captivated by the world of science and the joy of understanding how things work. In college, I initially pursued a degree in zoology, fueled by my childhood fascination with animals and my summer internship at a big cat sanctuary. However, as I took more classes in chemistry and microbiology, my interests started to shift towards molecular biology and genomics. The complexity and intricacy of life at a molecular level completely captured me.

Fueled by my newfound passion for molecular biology, I developed a keen interest in academic research. Hearing about the cutting-edge work being done by my professors and reading the latest journals was thrilling. I was particularly interested in the advancements being made in fields like aging and cancer. This is when I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in research.

Despite life's challenges, my eagerness to delve deeper into the world of research remains unchanged. With a solid foundation in laboratory research from my senior capstone project, I am excited to continue my journey and deepen my understanding.
