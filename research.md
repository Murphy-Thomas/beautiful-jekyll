I've always been captivated by the world of science and the joy of understanding how things work. In college, I initially pursued a degree in zoology, fueled by my childhood fascination with animals and my summer internship at a big cat sanctuary. However, as I took more classes in chemistry and microbiology, my interests started to shift towards molecular biology and genomics. The complexity and intricacy of life at a molecular level completely captured me.

Fueled by my newfound passion for molecular biology, I developed a keen interest in academic research. Hearing about the cutting-edge work being done by my professors and reading the latest journals was thrilling. Particularly, the advancements in the understanding of aging and cancer biology have captivated my imagination. The more I learned, the more I was convinced that a career in research was the right path for me. The thought of potentially making a tangible impacts on the world cementing my desire to pursue this career. 

Despite life's challenges, my eagerness to delve deeper into the world of research remains unchanged. With a solid foundation in laboratory research from my senior capstone project, I am excited to continue my journey and deepen my understanding.
